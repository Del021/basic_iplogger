# basic_iplogger

This is an iplogger in its beta version, I programmed this with the purpose of experimenting with web scraping and basic phishing techniques through a Qr code generator. There is a lot to fix and improve. That’s why I will now explain about its operation: 

Set a valid iplogger.org tracking URL, for example: 

(This is done on the iplogger page) https://iplogger.org/logger/yW1W4HX6W9eV/

~Suggestion: If you want to use a different URL than the one suggested, you can do so, just change the various interactions that b4s performs along with the lines of code related to the iplogger page.

[ * ] Commands: \`\`\`echo ‘https://iplogger.org/logger/yW1W4HX6W9eV/’ > url.dat\`\`\`

By entering the link correctly, if you try to run run.py, you will be able to access successfully:

[ * ] Commands: ```python3 run.py```

For any suggestions or feedback, I would appreciate it if you could let me know.
